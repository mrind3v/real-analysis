In mathematics, a **mathematical object** is an abstract concept or structure that we can define and study. Think of them as the fundamental "things" or "nouns" of mathematics.

Your instructor's statement is spot on. We don't discover these objects in nature; we define them by stating a set of rules, or **axioms**, that they must obey. Everything else we know about these objects is logically derived from these initial axioms.

### The Analogy of a Game ♟️

A great way to think about this is like defining a game, such as chess.

*   **Mathematical Objects**: These are like the game pieces (king, queen, pawn) and the board itself.
    
*   **Axioms**: These are the rules of the game. For example, "a pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally." You don't _prove_ this rule; you simply accept it as a fundamental truth of the game of chess.
    

From these basic rules (axioms), you can then deduce more complex strategies and theorems, like certain opening moves being advantageous.

### Objects in Real Analysis

In real analysis, the primary mathematical object you're studying is the **set of real numbers**, denoted by  $R$ .

All of the properties of the real numbers that you'll use in your course are derived from a handful of axioms that define what  $R$  _is_. These axioms fall into three categories:

1.  **The Field Axioms:** These are the basic rules of arithmetic. They define how addition ( $+$ ) and multiplication ( $\cdot$ ) work, including properties like commutativity ( $a+b=b+a$ ), associativity ( $a+\left(b+c\right)=\left(a+b\right)+c$ ), and the existence of identities (0 and 1) and inverses (negatives and reciprocals). These axioms establish  $R$  as a **field**.
    
2.  **The Order Axioms:** These axioms define the concept of order (i.e., less than,  $<$ , and greater than,  $>$ ). They establish rules for how inequalities interact with arithmetic. For example, if  $a<b$  and  $c>0$ , then  $ac<bc$ . These axioms, combined with the field axioms, establish  $R$  as an **ordered field**.
    
3.  **The Completeness Axiom:** This is the most important and subtle axiom in real analysis. It's what distinguishes the real numbers ( $R$ ) from the rational numbers ( $Q$ ). It essentially states that the real number line has no "gaps." A common way to state this is: "Every non-empty set of real numbers that has an upper bound has a least upper bound (or supremum)." This axiom is the foundation for concepts like limits, continuity, and convergence.
    

Other mathematical objects you'll encounter in real analysis are built upon the foundation of the real numbers, such as:

*   **Sets** (specifically, subsets of  $R$ )
    
*   **Functions** (which map real numbers to real numbers,  $f:R→R$ )
    
*   **Sequences** (an ordered list of real numbers)
    
*   **Series** (the sum of the terms of a sequence)
    

Each of these is also defined by its own set of properties, but they all ultimately rely on the axioms defining the real numbers themselves.
